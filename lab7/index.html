						This time around Jason did the HTML and CSS styling while Jesus did the JavaScript for the assignment.
						Overall, the biggest challenge Jason had was continuing his training on positions and sizes when it comes
						to individual elements. Colors are a no-brainer but positioning is still an annoying problem.
