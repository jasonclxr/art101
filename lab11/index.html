				Jason - The worst part was figuring out why my jQuery wasn’t working
				at all. Jesus and I messed with append, prepend, appendTo - you name
				it. What we finally found out was the problem was that lab11.js didn’t
				have the defer tag in it so the jquery was trying to work with what was
				basically an empty HTML doc. Once I added that everything worked flawlessly.
				The other hard part personally for me was getting the appending to
				work for multiple tags on tags. Adding a label tag onto a input tag onto a
				div on the doc was kind of confusing.
				<br><br>
				Jesus- The JS added buttons did not want to comply with my css.
				I tried to round them out and give them a gradient but those effects
				would clash to create a square with white cross in the center and
				gradient boxes in each corner. In the end I just decided that a
				simple gray button would still fit our website. Side note finding
				the right purple for this website took way too long. Also I had to
				figure out how to get emojis to work, turns out there needs to be
				an “;” at the end of the emoji code to stop it from nullifying
				literally all the code after it!
