			Hi guys! I'm Jason. I'm a third year Art & Design: Games and Playable Media major with a CS minor.<br>
			I'm pretty fluent in most popular languages (save for Python) like C++, C, Java, JavaScript, Lua<br>
			etc etc. I spend a lot of my time working on my Roblox games that I've built since high school. I'm<br>
			a huge fan of American football and the Seattle Seahawks (so if you want to talk to someone about<br>
			football look no further). I don't have that much experience with web development which is why I<br>
			was interested in this class, but I'm super excited to work with you guys!<br>
