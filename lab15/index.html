					In honor of this being our 15th lab for this class we decided to pay
					homage to the sponge bob meme of Mr. Krabs deliriously ringing a bell
					while screaming "day 15!". Thus this hurrendous color color scheme
					was born.
					<br>
					This episode of sponge bob is a constant mood for the average
					college student. Its got sleep deprevation and over working,
					what else describes the life of a college student as finals
					come around?

				Jason - I made the mistake of trying to go TOO hard on the
				JavaScript/AJAX side. I LOVE jQuery now however, that is an
				ACTUAL god send of a tool. My problem was I wanted to make
				this sort of like Pokemon index navigator where you could
				sort by different sides of Pokemon attributes and it would
				list everything out accordingly. The PROBLEM with that is
				the JSON endpoint on the website we were using didn’t
				really have a perfect uniform structure to how it send
				data, so having to make special cases for all of those
				was going to be a pain. For a project hell yeah, for a
				lab… maybe next time.
				<br>
				<br>
				Jesus - Aside from trying to make the image show up on
				the same line from the text everything went over pretty
				smoothly for me. Ran into an issue where elements became
				invisible but that was due to a “display: “ that didn't
				have a ; at the end to stop it from nullifying the rest
				of the code.
