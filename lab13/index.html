				Not much was changed to the design. The only big thing done to the CSS
				was the addition of the columns at the end that make the output

				Jason - The biggest challenge I had with this project was trying
				to think up a good way to manage the strings if it satisfied multiple
				cases. Eventually I just decided to have a bunch of if blocks that
				decide whether it satisfies the case, and if so, to concatenate onto a
				main string. Thenâ€¦ this would concatenate onto a bigger string that
				would eventually be outputted to the output div.
				<br><br>
				Jesus- Everything worked like a charm. The columns were added through
				the quick addition of "column-count: 5;". After that it was just some
				quick patches to get the JS created elements aligned and visible.
