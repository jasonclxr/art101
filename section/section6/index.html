					The video above is a funny meme that I found on Instagram, I'm not<br>
          sure where the anime is from, but the fact that it's the cheems makes <br>
          it funny. <br><br>
          The picture is just my background that I have for my computer. I can't <br>
          remember where I found it, but I thought it was cool because of the <br>
          pattern.
