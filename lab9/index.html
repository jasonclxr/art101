			<p>Jason -
				My biggest problem was getting the slicing to work on the tab title
				to work correctly. We spent probably about 20 minutes laughing over
				it because we couldn’t get it to not be
				“Llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllab 9” because I couldn’t get
				the right slicing to work with the strings. My next issue was
				getting the iterator variables to work which was tricky because I
				tried being cute and fancy with the math (which always blows up
				in my face)
				<br><br>
				Jesus - CSS hates me at the best of times. I tried to get a nice
				border on top but then the words were both inside yet floating
				outside of their div container. Free to roam the page these words
				ran amuck causing more strife with each attempt to fix them.
				Eventually I gave up on the top section and cut it out but mark
				my words I shall avenge myself next lab.

			<p>This was meant to have a white top border above the blue section
				with the words "Lab 9" and one side and "Jason Blecman and Jesus
				Picos" on the other. We'll figure it out for next time!</p>
