			<h2>ABOUT ME (Jason Blecman)</h2>
			<p id = "about_me">Heyo! I'm Jason! I'm a third year Art & Design: Games and Playable Media major.<br>
				My favorite hobbies include, programming, working on cars, tutoring, watching football<br>
				and making games. I've been working on games since I was about 11, and have always been<br>
				fascinated with the 3D world. <br><br>
				I've mostly expressed these passions through the game	development platform Roblox, <br>
				where I've been able to make a pretty successful game called Football Universe. The game<br>
				has spawned a community with active player counts numbering around 900 to 1,200 active <br>
				concurrent players. I've made a lot of friendships around this community and learned a lot <br>
				about what it means to be apart of a group and a team player.<br>
